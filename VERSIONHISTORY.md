# Harley - Version history
Updates by version

### Version: 1.2.8

Minor: 
- Fixed a bug with a missing package version, that lead to a crash
- Added permissions to building on MacOS. Users otherwise had to manually change permissions

### Version: 1.2.6

Minor:
- Fixed a bug in colocalization when in preprocessing step ref and fluorescence image were not the same size. Only applies to data generated prior to Harley 1.2.5.

### Version: 1.2.5

Minor:
- Added a fix for the preprocessing pipeline. If the ref image and the fluorescence image are not the same size, the latter will be adjusted by adding a border. This led to bugs with the cell files later on.

### Version: 1.2.3

Major:
- Changed the way *.cells files are stored. They are now keyed by input file names and it is possible to edit contents. Warning: Older files will automatically be upgraded on first load without prompt. 

Minor:
- Model Training: Fixed labeling issue, where split polygons could not be removed easily by clicking.
- Data Loader: UI Change for adding batches, batch creator and added option to apply pipeline parameters to all batches with one click.
- Worked on ability to run HARLEY more in the background (progress display, webworkers).
- Small bug fixes and improved hints in various places. 

### Version: 1.2.2

Minor:
- Long folder names in file and batch dialogues are now shortened with [...] for clarity. 
- Full file name now displayed in popover in data input.
- Coloc: Bugfix on export and display if no foci present
- Coloc: Graph view displays hints if no data is present, instead of empty graphs
- Coloc: Fixed various bugs occuring with messy data, mostly fail safes.

### Version: 1.2.1

Minor:
- Added debug menu for single pipelines when 'd' is pressed. Currently can only delete cookies for a single pipeline.
- Changed embedded Tutorial Videos
- Bugfixes: Regarding Foci Detection under certain conditions

### Version: 1.2.0

Major:

- Added a new Pipeline for parametrized foci detection without model, useful to quickly extract obvious foci.

### Version: 1.1.7

Minor:
- Bugfix: Data was not always reloaded when starting a new batch. 

### Version: 1.1.6

Major:
- Foci Detection: Fixed bug where detected foci would not be merged correctly and made improvements to merging when adjusting size of foci. 

Minor:
- Batch indicator on top left, now displays currently loaded file(s)
- Foci Detection: Brightness values exported are now not normalized.
- Foci Detection: Added Sorting to cells and touched up UI.
- Colocalization: Added parameter to toggle normalizaton of images 
- Colocalization: Fixed crash in scatter plot 
- Colocalization: Various changes in wording/explanations 
- Colocalization: Added info panel to Cells overview with average PCC and other counts.
- Bugfix, normalization failure under certain conditions
- Bugfix, cell images appeared chopped off
- File Picker will display folder that are not permitted and should not crash on permission errors 

### Version: 1.1.5

Major:
- Cell Detection: Now possible to export mask files, with precise masks, instead of mask images. This gives ~2px more precise outlines.
- Pre Processing: Suggested to use new mask files now. Now possible to overlay reference images and fluorescence for better insight into data.

Minor: 
- Pre Processing: Output cells file now also contains ref images, for further use in the future. 
- Pre Processing: Added possibility to shift detected masks against fluorescence image.
- Bugfix: crash due to bug in mask import.
- Bugfix: Batch file selection did not work properly for some patterns. 

### Version: 1.1.4

Minor:
- Coloc: Added scatter plot regression
- Coloc: Added scatter plot export
- Coloc: Raw data export extended with foci details
- Foci Detection: Possibility to sort out cells by max intensity
- Foci Detection: Temporary adjustment of contrast slider to better pick quality cells.

### Version: 1.1.3

Major:
- Added scatter plots to Coocalization Pipeline 

Minor:
- Foci Detection changed CSV to XLSX and added more evaluations
- Added XLSX Export of Colocalization Data
- Bugfixes in pipelinehandling 

### Version: 1.1.2
Major:
- Added Pearson Correlation to Coloc Pipeline 

Minor:
- Improvements in Colocalization Pipeline UI


### Version: 1.1.1
Minor:
- Bugfix with BatchCreator fixed on Windows
- Bugfix with restarting software on Windows

### Version: 1.1.0
Major: 
- Added Colocalization pipeline to Harley

Minor:
- Varius small bugfixes in UI 

### Version: 1.0.1
Major:
- Added possibility to manually add/remove foci after model detection
- Added scale parameters to batches, so outputs are in nm instead of pixels

Minor:
- Fixed missing library bug in cell fitting
- Integration of Youtubetube tutorials into UI and added intro screen

### Version: 1.0.0

- First major release with 4 pipelines.
- Along with [Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.29.470484v1?rss=1) publication

### Version: 0.0.6

Minor:
- Fixed bugs with Polygon Displays, where the mask would not sit aligned with image.
- Fixed some typos and extended some Help strings

### Version: 0.0.5

Major:
- Add new Ridge Detection, can detect lawns of yeast really well.
- Dramatically increased speed of cell detection about 10x faster 

Minor:
- Fixed bug in mask export, if no selection has been made
- Now saving the last used pipeline, and not starting always in default
- In CellFitting and MaskTightening steps: Displays cell count in top left and you can toggle mask by pressing "1" and "2" keys

### Version: 0.0.4

- Added possibility to ignore cells during foci detection
- Added possibility to hold SHIFT key to temporary make foci invisible, for better usability.
- Modified export to mention ignored cells and cells with no foci, by adding a new comment column

### Version: 0.0.3

- Completely redid foci detection algorithm, seems to work a lot better now
- Improved UI and new parameters for foci detection

### Version: 0.0.2

- Fixed Sliders. They won't trigger algorithm rerun, until user let's go mouse or leaves textfield.
- Added scale to outputs and inputs, so that Foci output is now in Âµm instead of px. The scale comes from the metadata of the original DV image.
- Improved UI for Foci Detection in Curvature Mode. Now possible to add/remove single foci.
- The Brightness mode for foci detection is now work in progress. It is unreliable. Maybe do not rely on it for now.
- Brightnessmode now produces consistently tight outlines for foci. 

### Version: 0.0.1
 
- Initial release
