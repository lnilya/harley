    This pipeline is used to detect foci, without using a trained model. Which is useful in a few instances.
    First of all if your data contains a very simple dataset, e.g. a single bright focus per cell, as is often the case
    with spindle pole bodies for example. In such cases there are few "wrong" foci which the model requres to learn.
    Using the parameter approach in this case is faster and more convenient than training a model.
